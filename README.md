The Weather Information Fetcher is a Python-based command-line tool that retrieves and displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides key weather details, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

Users can enter the name of a city to fetch its current weather data. The program handles invalid city names gracefully, providing clear feedback. It also includes error handling for network issues and unexpected API responses. Users can exit the application anytime by typing "exit."
